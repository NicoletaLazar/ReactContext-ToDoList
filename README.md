# ReactContext-ToDoList

## Where you can add/remove tasks to your list

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Technologies Used

### `React`

A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

### `Context API`

Context API allows data to be passed through a component tree without having to pass props manually at every level. This makes it easier to share data between components.
Context API consists of two main components: the context provider and the context consumer.

- The provider is responsible for creating and managing the context, which holds the data to be shared between components.
- While the consumer is used to access the context and its data from within a component.

### `Chakra UI`

A simple, modular and accessible component library that gives us the building blocks we need to build our React applications.
